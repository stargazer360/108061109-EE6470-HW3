# Homework 2
A 3x3 approximated Gaussian blur filter for 256x256 bmp images connected with tlm bus.
## Compile & Run
 - `$ mkdir build`
 - `$ cd build`
 - `$ cmake ..`
 - `$ make`
 - `$ make run`

An output image named out.bmp will generate, which is the filtered result of image input.bmp.
You can replace input.bmp with a 256x256 bmp images with the same name to get corresponding output.
